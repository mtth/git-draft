# Interactive user feedback resources

UX

Probably best to start with the simplest way of gathering user feedback:
simple input in the terminal, with option to open an editor.

```
> Editing files...
> <some question>
[ i: answer inline, e: answer in editor, q: quit ]
```

```
> <some question?> <i: answer inline, e: answer in editor, q: quit> i

<some response>
```

```
> Editing files...
> Performing some update...
? Asking some question?

> <some question>

Provide feedback now? [Yne] y
<some response>
```

Later on, we can use interactivity toolkits, such as:
